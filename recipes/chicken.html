        <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon garlic powder</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon black cracked pepper</li>
        <li>2 large boneless skinless chicken breasts,
             halved horizontally to make 4 fillets*</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon unsalted butter as needed</li>
        <li>8 ounces (250g) brown or Cremini mushrooms, sliced</li>
        <li>4-5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>3/4 cup dry Marsala wine</li>
        <li>1 1/4 cup low-sodium chicken broth (or stock)</li>
        <li>3/4 cup heavy cream (thickened cream,
             evaporated milk or half and half may also be used)*</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fresh chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HOW TO COOK</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix the flour, salt, garlic powder and pepper in a shallow bowl.
             Dredge the chicken in the flour mixture and shake off excess.</li>
        <li>Heat 1 tablespoon oil and 2 tablespoons butter in a 12-inch pan or 
            skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering. Fry 2 of the chicken breasts until 
            golden-brown on both sides (about 3 to 4 minutes per side). Transfer to warm plate,
             tent with foil and keep warm. Repeat the same with the remaining 2 chicken breasts.
        </li>
        <li>In the same pan with remaining pan grease leftover from the chicken, melt 1 tablespoon of butter. 
            Add the mushrooms and for 2-3 minutes until browned, scraping away at any of the leftover chicken
             bits off the bottom of the pan.</li>
        <li>Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Pour in the Marsala and the broth and simmer until reduced by half and starting to thicken,
             (about 10-15 minutes).</li>
        <li>Pour in the cream and return the chicken back into the sauce. Cook until the sauce thickens 
            (about 3 minutes). Garnish with chopped parsley and serve immediately. 
            (The sauce will continue to thicken off the heat.)</li>
        <li>Serve over cooked angel hair pasta (or pasta of choice), rice, potatoes, 
            cauliflower rice or zucchini noodles, if desired.</li>
