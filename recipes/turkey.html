    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <p>these ones are very delicious and pretty much a good way to dispose leftover food.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 sheets Frozen puff pastry, thawed*</li>
        <li>1 Egg, beaten</li>
        <li>2 Tbsp Dijon mustard</li>
        <li>1 cup Leftover mashed potatoes</li>
        <li>3 ounces Gruyère cheese, grated</li>
        <li>½ cup Cranberry sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups Shredded leftover turkey</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp Dried minced onion</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HOW TO COOK</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 400°F. </li>
        <li>Cut each puff pastry sheet into four squares equal in size, 8 total.</li>
        <li>In a small bowl combine the beaten egg with 2 tablespoons cold water.</li>
        <li>Using a pastry brush, brush a ½ inch egg wash boarder all the way around 
            the edge of each puff pastry square. This will help the pastry stick together 
            when you fold it in half.</li>
        <li>Equally divide the dijon mustard, spreading it on the inside of the pastry dough. </li>
        <li>On one half of each of the pastries add 2 tablespoons mashed potatoes, 
            followed by 3 tablespoons cheese, 1 ounce (2 tablespoons) of turkey and 1 tablespoon cranberry sauce.
             Fold the pastry dough over the ingredients and press the edges down tight to seal</li>
        <li>Arrange prepared hand pies on a large parchment lined baking sheet.**</li>
        <li>Brush the tops with remaining egg wash and sprinkle with minced onion and flaky salt..</li>
        <li>Bake on the center rack for 15-18 minutes until golden brown. Serve warm.</li>
