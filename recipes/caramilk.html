    <h2>INGREDIENTS</h2>
    <p> ingredients pretty much available everywhere.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp vanilla custard powder</li>
        <li>1 cup milk</li>
        <li>180g block Caramilk chocolate, chopped</li>
        <li>24 choc ripple biscuits </li>
        <li>60g dark chocolate, melted, to drizzle </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>HOW TO BAKE</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Place custard powder in a saucepan. Stir in about 2 tablespoons milk,
             until smooth and combined. Stir in remaining milk. Place saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook,
              stirring, for 8 to 10 minutes or until custard simmers and thickens. Add chopped Caramillk. Stir until smooth.
         Transfer to a heatproof bowl. Cover surface with plastic wrap. Set aside for 30 minutes to cool. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until cold. </li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 180C/160C fan-forced</li>
        <li>Place 1 biscuit on top of each hole of 2 x 12-hole round-based shallow patty pans. Bake for 3 to 4 minutes or until biscuits have softened.
             Working very quickly, use a teaspoon to shape the biscuits into a cup, using the pan as a guide. Cool for 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Whisk custard until smooth. Divide evenly among biscuits. Refrigerate for 1 hour or until set. Drizzle with melted chocolate.
             Stand for 5 minutes. Serve. </li>
    </ol>
